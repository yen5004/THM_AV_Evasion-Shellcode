# Task 11 Conclusion

Task 11 Conclusion

In this room, we have explored some strategies available to an attacker to circumvent AV engines that rely on disk-based detection only. While this is just one of the mechanisms available to any modern AV engine, we should be able to at least deliver our payloads to our victim's disk as a first step. Bypassing in-memory detection and other advanced detection mechanisms are left for a future room. You may want to check the [Runtime Detection Evasion](https://tryhackme.com/room/runtimedetectionevasion) for more information on bypassing further Windows security mechanisms that may prevent your payloads from triggering.

Remember that the success of any encrypter, encoder or packer, will largely depend on AV engines not knowing any signatures for them. Therefore, being able to customize your own payloads is critical when trying to bypass any real-world solution.
