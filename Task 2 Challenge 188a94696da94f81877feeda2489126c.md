# Task 2 Challenge

Task 2 Challenge

Start Machine

In this challenge, we prepared a Windows machine with a web application to let you upload your payloads. Once uploaded, the payloads will be checked by an AV and executed if found to be clean of malware. The main goal of this challenge is to evade Antivirus software installed on the VM and capture the flag in the file system. Feel free to try all of the techniques discussed throughout the room by uploading them to **`http://MACHINE_IP/`**.

Points to remember:

- Try to combine the techniques discussed in this room.
- The website supports EXE files only.
- Once the AV scans the uploaded file and no malicious code is detected, the file gets executed. Thus, if everything is put together correctly, then you should receive a reverse shell.

You can ignore the questions for this task for now, but be sure to come back to them once you have successfully bypassed the AV and gained a shell.

Deploy the attached VM to follow up with the content of the room before continuing to the next section! The VM will deploy in-browser and should appear automatically in the Split View. In case the VM is not visible, use the blue Show Split View button at the top-right of the page. If you prefer connecting via RDP, you can do so with the following credentials:
